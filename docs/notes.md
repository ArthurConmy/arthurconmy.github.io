This page will hopefully store my notes on various maths courses, and will hopefully grow over time.

### Maths

## Part II

# Mathematics of Machine Learning <a href="../assets/MML/MML.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, complete.

This is a new course, and I am not aware of any complete sets of notes available other than these at present. Highlights are the much nicer references to previous equations than in existing notes, and also the elementary proof of the full form of Hoeffding's Lemma.

## Part IB

# Geometry <a href="../assets/Geometry/Geom.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, near complete.

I found this course hard, and found a number of sections of the course covered at a rapid speed. My goal in these notes is to distill the important intuitions, but also fill in details in the sections I was less clear about.

All sections of the course are covered in some detail, except the final section on hyperbolic geometry.

# Analysis <a href="../assets/Anal.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, very rough.

<!-- Currently only covers a useful trick to verify the general derivative form of Cauch -->

Currently covers some more background on the differentiation section of Analysis and Topology, as well as a technical detail that allows the general Cauchy's Integral Formula for derivatives to be deduced.

### Machine Learning

# AI Safety Workshop (CUAI) <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Yfk1a4EkCEEddzW-iNfIaH_8-yPK3Ddo" target="_blank">[link]</a>

A workshop (with exercises!) on the 'off switch' problem in AI. Explores 'safe interruptibility': one way of thinking about this problem in the context on current Reinforcement Learning systems.

## Cambridge Societies

I spent some time at Cambridge in different societies:

* Founded, was president of, and put [talks](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022220732/https://uccps.soc.srcf.net/talksarchive/) together with the UCCPS. 
* Into [Effective Altruism](https://web.archive.org/web/20210925210707/https://www.eacambridge.org/about).
* Organised [workshops](http://web.archive.org/web/20220121045119/https://cuai.org.uk/workshop-gpt-3-and-codex/) with the [CUAI](http://web.archive.org/web/20220121182105/https://cuai.org.uk/committee/).
* A lot of [running](https://web.archive.org/web/20210925205921/https://cuhh.soc.srcf.net/about/committee/juniormembers/ez-run-organisers/), too.

<!-- In future, I'd like to expand this when I know more analysis. -->
<!-- # Principles of Statistics <a href="../assets/PoS/pos.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>. created 22nd October 2021. -->
<!-- I have just started writing up notes for the Principles of Statistics course. -->
