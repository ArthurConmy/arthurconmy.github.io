\section{Introduction}

The course will be divided into three parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Statistical learning theory (including empirical risk minimization).
    \item Computation (including (stochastic) gradient descent).
    \item Popular methods in practise.
\end{itemize}

The course will move from a more theoretical background to practical things. There is a significant gap between the theory and the practise in machine learning, as will be seen in the course.

% The most important prerequisite is 1A Probability. IB Optimization, IB Analysis and Topology and IB Statistics provide some background, though only in parts (e.g. convex optimization, cts functions attaining their bounds on closed bounded sets and linear regression for building intuition).
