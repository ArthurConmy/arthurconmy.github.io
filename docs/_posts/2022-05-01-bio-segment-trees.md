<!-- On 7th May 2021, I gave a presentation at the Cambridge Image Analyis (CIA, that work within DAMTP) group seminar. -->

<!-- My research has been using the exciting (and scary!) image priors that the StyleGAN model provides (see http://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ if you are not scared!). -->

I helped out at the 2022 British Informatics Olympiad Round 2: \url{olympiad.org.uk}.

I presented an introduction to segment trees <a href="../../../assets/SegmentTrees.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
