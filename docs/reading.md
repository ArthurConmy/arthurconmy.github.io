## The Structure of Scientific Revolutions ( \* \*  )
<i>22nd February 2022</i>

# Biggest takeaway

There is an observable pattern in scientific progression, namely through (phases)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions#Phases]. Notable 'normal science', which consists of <i>puzzle solving</i>, is followed by crisis, when (perhaps) puzzles no longer have well-defined solutions, if solutions at all, within the current scientific <i>paradigm</i> (a word the book popularised).

# Why you shouldn't read this book

There are few empirical tests carried out, and no effort to gather data on scientific progress, and instead I think a couple of examples are very overfitted to (namely, Aristotle to Newton, Newton to Einstein, Ptolemy to Copernicus, as well as the discovery of oxygen). 

## The Black Swan ( \* \* \*  )
<i>1st February 2022</i>

# Biggest takeaway

The real world is generally modelled by a normal distribution. However, there are important distributions in life that are very much NOT normal. For example, heights of people in cm may be

170, 180, 160, 155, 200, ...

which is certainly modellable as a normal distrbution. But consider <i>book sales</i> (in any bookshop except maybe the most boring mainstream one there is). You're likely to scan past books you've never heard of, for specific audiences (e.g academic texts) or just flops and then BOOM! Harry Potter, or Twilight, or something like that. The number of book sales will look like

1040, 402, 500124123, 120, ...

which is very very different to the above distribution of heights. Rises and falls of the stock market are another example. The book makes a stronger claim, however, that there exist very-not-normal distributions that are also very difficult if not impossible to predict, and it is delusion to believe they can be predicted.

# Why you shouldn't read this book

The author has an axe to grind, which at best makes the read enjoyable, but at worst makes it irritating.

Too many to count. System one and system two. Planning fallacy. Narrative fallacies. Which professions do have experts, and which don't.
