Hello! I'm Arthur Conmy, a third year undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge studying mathematics. I have been interested in competitive programming since high school, and also am dabbling in machine learning.

Here you can find some <a href="/notes/">notes</a> on maths, some <a href="/cia_slides/">slides</a> on some research I have done, and a brief <a href="/mesa_opt/">note</a> on *mesa-optimization*, a concept in AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).
