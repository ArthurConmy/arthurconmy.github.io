On 7th May 2021, I gave a presentation at the Cambridge Image Analyis (CIA, that work within DAMTP) group seminar.

My research has been using the exciting (and scary!) image priors that the StyleGAN model provides (see http://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ if you are not scared!).

Ths slides are available <a href="../../../assets/Presentation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
