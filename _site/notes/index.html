<p>This page will hopefully store my notes on various maths courses, and will hopefully grow over time.</p>

<h2 id="part-ib">Part IB</h2>

<h1 id="geometry-link-incomplete-last-updated-2904">Geometry <a href="../assets/Geometry.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, incomplete, last updated 29/04</h1>

<p>I found this course hard, and found a number of sections of the course covered at a rapid speed. My focus in these notes is to distill the important intuitions, as well as fill in details in the sections I was less clear about.</p>

<h2 id="part-ii">Part II</h2>

<h1 id="mathematics-of-machine-learning-link-complete">Mathematics of Machine Learning <a href="../assets/MML.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, complete</h1>

<p>This is a new course, and I am not aware of any complete sets of notes available other than these at present.</p>
