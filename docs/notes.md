This page will hopefully store my notes on various maths courses, and will hopefully grow over time.

## Part IB

# Geometry <a href="../assets/Geom.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, incomplete, last updated 20th June 2021.

I found this course hard, and found a number of sections of the course covered at a rapid speed. My goal in these notes is to distill the important intuitions, but also fill in details in the sections I was less clear about.

All sections of the course are covered in some detail, except the final section on hyperbolic geometry.

# Analysis <a href="../assets/Anal.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, last updated 20th June 2021.

<!-- Currently only covers a useful trick to verify the general derivative form of Cauch -->

Currently covers some more background on the differentiation section of Analysis and Topology, as well as a technical detail that allows the general Cauchy's Integral Formula for derivatives to be deduced.

In future, I'd like to expand this when I know more analysis.

## Part II

# Mathematics of Machine Learning <a href="../assets/MML.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, complete.

This is a new course, and I am not aware of any complete sets of notes available other than these at present. Currently, the references throughout the document are broken (is there an easy fix for this?!).

# Principles of Statistics <a href="../assets/PoS/pos.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>. created 22nd October 2021.

I have just started writing up notes for the Principles of Statistics course.
