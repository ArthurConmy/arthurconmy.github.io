title: Motivating mesa-optimization

This post is written as part of the [AGI Safety Fundamentals Course](https://www.eacambridge.org/agi-safety-fundamentals), organised by [Effective Altruism Cambridge](https://www.eacambridge.org).

One of the first technical concepts the AGI Safety Fundamentals course covers is *mesa-optimization*. At first, I struggledto find motivation for the concept: not only could I not see why it was likely to occur in an optimization process, but also I could not see why it warranted splitting the alignment problem in two halves (*inner alignment* is the problem that arises from mesa-optimization).

In this post, I do not explain mesa-optimization. Instead, I write a background that I wish I had had before being introduced to the concept.

# Optimization

To understand mesa-optimization, optimization must first be understood. Rohin Shah mentions.
