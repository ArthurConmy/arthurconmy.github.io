# Personal website

This repository is for my personal website, available at https://www.arthurconmy.github.io and currently significantly in need of further development!

# Developing (mostly for my own reference doing this again later)

* See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

# TODO

- [ ] Tidy up `assets`.
- [ ] Automatic LaTeX building from `.tex` files.
