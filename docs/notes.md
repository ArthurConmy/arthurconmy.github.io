This page will hopefully store my notes on various maths courses, and will hopefully grow over time.

## Part IB

# Geometry <a href="../assets/Geometry.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, incomplete, last updated 16th May 2021

I found this course hard, and found a number of sections of the course covered at a rapid speed. My goal in these notes is to distill the important intuitions, but also fill in details in the sections I was less clear about.

## Part II

# Mathematics of Machine Learning <a href="../assets/MML.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, complete

This is a new course, and I am not aware of any complete sets of notes available other than these at present.
