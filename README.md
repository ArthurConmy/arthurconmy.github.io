Hi, I'm a second year undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge studying mathematics. You can read my reviews on the courses as part of the Mathmo Survival Guide: https://hh457.user.srcf.net/mathmo-guide/.

I'm also interested in computer programming. You can find me on CodeForces (https://codeforces.com/profile/arthurconmy) as well as several other competitive programming websites.
