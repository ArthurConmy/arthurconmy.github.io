This page will hopefully store my notes on various maths courses, and will hopefully grow over time.

## Part IB

# Geometry <a href="../assets/Geom.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, incomplete, last updated 29th May 2021.

I found this course hard, and found a number of sections of the course covered at a rapid speed. My goal in these notes is to distill the important intuitions, but also fill in details in the sections I was less clear about.

# Analysis <a href="../assets/Anal.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, last updated 30th May 2021.

Only review material not lectured is covered here; I hope it provides more background for some of the course.

## Part II

# Mathematics of Machine Learning <a href="../assets/MML.pdf" target="_blank">[link]</a>, complete.

This is a new course, and I am not aware of any complete sets of notes available other than these at present.
