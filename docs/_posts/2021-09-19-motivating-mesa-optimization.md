title: Motivating mesa-optimization

This post is written as part of the [AGI Safety Fundamentals Course](https://www.eacambridge.org/agi-safety-fundamentals), organised by [Effective Altruism Cambridge](https://www.eacambridge.org).

One of the first technical concepts the AGI Safety Fundamentals course covers is *mesa-optimization*. At first, I struggledto find motivation for the concept: not only could I not see why it was likely to occur in an optimization process, but also I could not see why it warranted splitting the alignment problem in two halves (*inner alignment* is the problem that arises from mesa-optimization).

In this post, I do not explain mesa-optimization. Instead, I write a background that I wish I had had before being introduced to the concept.

In the alignment newsletter that covers the original mesa-optimization paper[^fn1] a good definition of optimization, along with a lack of existing example of mesa-optimization are two big sources of confusion regarding optimization. These will therefore be the two topics covered.

# Optimization

To understand mesa-optimization, optimization must first be understood. In fact,  

# Examples

Here is some text.[^fn2]
