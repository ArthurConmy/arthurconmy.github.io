On 23rd September 2021, I gave a presentation internally in the Probability team at Facebook, on generative modelling.

I covered the abstraction for this wide problem, some known approaches and challenges (with a particular focus on GANs) and the most recent techniques (diffusion models).

The slides are available <a href="../../../assets/generative_modelling.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
