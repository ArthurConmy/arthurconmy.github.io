Hello! I'm Arthur Conmy, a third year undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge studying mathematics. I am hoping to do as much good as possible, specifically by making machine learning not make the future terrible. This summer, I am interning at [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/) in Berkeley, California.

<!-- Here you can find some  on maths, some <a href="/cia_slides/">slides</a> on some research I have done, and a brief <a href="/mesa_opt/">note</a> on *mesa-optimization*, a concept in AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).  -->

I try and [read things]() too.
